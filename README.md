# CrewAI Stock Market Analyst

**Advanced AI Financial Analysis:** End-to-end stock market forecasting and analysis with multi-agent collaboration.

This project is a sophisticated financial analysis application built on the **CrewAI framework**, providing an end-to-end pipeline for automated stock market analysis.  
It leverages a team of specialized AI agentsâ€”a **researcher**, a **financial analyst**, and a **reporting analyst**â€”to generate comprehensive, real-time stock market reports.  

The system is designed to provide actionable insights by integrating up-to-the-minute market data with advanced predictive modeling and presents the results in an **interactive web application**.

Simply provide a stock ticker and a forecast period, and the crew will deliver a detailed financial report, complete with:
- An **executive summary**
- A **model-based forecast analysis**
- **Investor recommendations**

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: A crew of three distinct agents works together to perform a complete analysis.  
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Uses the `SerperDevTool` and a custom `StockDataTool` to gather the latest news, analyst ratings, and competitor information from sources like Yahoo Finance.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: The Financial Analyst agent utilizes a custom `ProphetForecastTool` to generate future price predictions and confidence intervals.  
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: The final output is a well-structured, easy-to-read financial report in Markdown format.  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly Streamlit application allows for easy input and a clean, organized display of the final report.

## How It Works
The project follows a sequential process, with each agent performing a specialized task:

1. **Researcher Agent**  
   - Gathers raw, up-to-the-minute information on the specified stock.  
   - Searches the web for recent news, major announcements, and analyst ratings.  
   - Provides a **qualitative foundation** for the report.  

2. **Financial Analyst Agent**  
   - Takes raw data from the researcher.  
   - Uses the Prophet model to perform **quantitative analysis**.  
   - Forecasts future price trends and provides data points like `yhat`, `yhat_lower`, and `yhat_upper`.  

3. **Reporting Analyst Agent**  
   - Synthesizes all information from the previous agents.  
   - Compiles qualitative research and quantitative predictions into a **professional financial report**.
